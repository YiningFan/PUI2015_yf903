Clarity: the plot clearly showed the relationship of average trip duration between subscribers and costumers. There are some labels on the points and a fit line to indicate the negative correlation. However, there are some confusions as well. The units of label and units for the legend do not appear to be the same. 
Esthetic: the points on the plot should be labeled more clearly. Graduate colors could be a good method, but too many categories may be unnecessary. 
Improvements: I would suggest to emphasize more on the day average value. Instead of labelling all other values in the plots, the red point should be labeled. Also, use less categories and more extinguished symologies for different values.
