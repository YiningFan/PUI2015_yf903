+
+NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
+=================================
+
+kvp
+===
+nice color choice: avoiding blue and pink/red for male female is a good idea to avoid triggering preconceptions
+
+robust to color blindness
+
+low resolution (typical of seaborn) is questionable (remember tufte's rules)
+
+labels too small
+
+legend too small
+
+refer to gende, not sex.
+
+the artificial lower limit to the age gives the odd all equal upper quartile, and should be explained in the caption or in a text
+
+
+efzfish
+=======
+too many classes for redeability: they end up being indistinguishable in the plot
+
+the three dots in the legend (default) should be changed to 1 point since they are redundant and in a plot like this they overlap
+
+the emptiness of the plot makes it difficult to see structure: a compressed y axis would be better
+
+the number of users is redundant with the size of the dot. information should be delivered once clearly, but only once
+
+
+
+missing vrmotupalli. did you contact him? he was responsive by email
